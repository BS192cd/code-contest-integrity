Converting a decimal place value into a Roman numeral has the following rules: If the value does not start with 4 or 9, select the symbol of the maximal value that can be subtracted from the input, append that symbol to the result, subtract its value, and convert the remainder to a Roman numeral. If the value starts with 4 or 9 use the **subtractive form** representing one symbol subtracted from the following symbol, for example, 4 is 1 (`I`) less than 5 (`V`): `IV` and 9 is 1 (`I`) less than 10 (`X`): `IX`. Only the following subtractive forms are used: 4 (`IV`), 9 (`IX`), 40 (`XL`), 90 (`XC`), 400 (`CD`) and 900 (`CM`). Only powers of 10 (`I`, `X`, `C`, `M`) can be appended consecutively at most 3 times to represent multiples of 10. You cannot append 5 (`V`), 50 (`L`), or 500 (`D`) multiple times.

The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`. Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used: `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9. `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90. `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.
